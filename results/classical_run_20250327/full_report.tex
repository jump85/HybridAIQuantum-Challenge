which explains 93.70% of the variance in the data.
A simple neural network classifier was then trained on these reduced features.

PCA reduced the original 784-dimensional space (28×28 images) to 126 dimensions
while preserving 93.70% of the variance.

The classical PCA-based approach achieves 94.33% accuracy on the validation set.
